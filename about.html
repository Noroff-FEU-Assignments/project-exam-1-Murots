                <h2><span class="uppercase">Background</span></h2>
                <p>We are of the generation that was born and raised with a message of an increasingly dark outlook for our planet and our environment. Here in the north, we are currently relatively mildly affected by climate change, but here too we are experiencing the danger signals. The glaciers are melting, more frequent droughts and extreme weather, and if you look closely - fewer insects. We took it to heart to make the living conditions of our little friends a little better, if very locally. We decided to transform a lifeless garden, hoping to make new acquaintances.</p>

                        <h2><span class="uppercase">Mission</span></h2>
                        <p>No other living being has contributed to changing the landscape and climate more than humans. We build and demolish, we retrieve and we deposit. As a small counterweight to this culture, we have allowed grass and plants to grow wild. With perplexed neighbours, the wild plants have risen in step with the entry of new species. Dead trees have been brought in as housing. Garden pond created as a refuge for bathing, drinking, washing, egg-laying and shelter. To our excitement, we have seen how our small ecosystem has changed from a grassy desert to a bustling oasis, also with better conditions for growing our own food. It gives a very special calm to see it unfold, and to see life thriving. That is why we are also happy to share our experiences of the process.</p>

                <h2><span class="uppercase">Aspiration</span></h2>
                <p>We know that our contribution will not save the planet, nor the wildlife. And we know very well how easy it is to become apathetic or indifferent to problems that do not immediately concern ourselves. Nevertheless, we hope to be able to inspire others who want to make a small difference where they can, while at the same time we want to point out the useful value in a rich diversity. Our insects are often misunderstood, and perhaps a little alienated. We think they deserve a better reputation. As the saying goes: "many small streams make a big river".</p>
